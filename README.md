This repository contains the code to go with a sample video submission for a course module titled "Exploring a Knowledge Graph in Neo4j with the Cypher Query Language."
The purpose of this course is to introduce some basic commands with the Cypher query language for querying a pre-built knowledge graph.  The Cypher commands can be 
found in the file `cypher_commands.cql`, located in the root directory of this repository.  

The knowledge graph for this video was created by the author using natural language processing (NLP) from the Wikipedia page for Barack Obama.  Should you be interested 
in creating this graph for yourself, you are encouraged to consult with [this course video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSCzMOcqgq8) by the author, with code available from [this repository](https://github.com/cj2001/nodes2021_kg_workshop).
